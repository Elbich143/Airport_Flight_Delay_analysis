# ✈️ Airport Flight Delay Analysis (SQL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **airport flight delays** using **SQL** to uncover patterns, trends, and key factors contributing to delays.  
The analysis helps understand how delays vary by airport, airline, and time, supporting data-driven decision making in aviation operations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze flight delay trends across different airports  
- Identify airlines with higher delay frequencies  
- Understand peak delay times and delay patterns  
- Practice real-world SQL querying and data analysis  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Language:** SQL  
- **Environment:** MySQL Workbench  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

---

- **Project.sql** → Contains all SQL queries used for analysis

## 🧠 SQL Concepts Used
- SELECT statements  
- WHERE & ORDER BY clauses  
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)  
- GROUP BY & HAVING  
- JOINs (INNER / LEFT)  
- Subqueries  
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
- Data filtering and sorting  

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Total number of flights and delayed flights  
- Airport-wise delay comparison  
- Airline-wise delay analysis  
- Identification of high-delay airports  
- Delay trends based on time and location
